# Unstoppable Ethereum etherminerVer
A python script for ethermine that doesn't allow your rig to stop

<b>Requirements</b>

<ul>
<li>A Windows machine (tested on Win10 x64)</li>
<li>An Ethereum miner (tested on <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1433925.0">Claymore miner</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://ethermine.org/">ethermine</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-362/">Python 3.6</a></li>
</ul>

<b>How it works</b>

The script gets the hashrate of your rig from the ethermine api, if the hashrate is zero that means the miner is not working and it restarts.

If you want a more in depth explanation see the source code that is all commented.

<li>Install Python 3.6</li>
<li>Download this files to your miner folder</li>
